## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
*"hack.chat is a minimal, distraction-free, accountless, logless, disappearing chat service which is easily deployable as your own service."* - [hack.chat](https://github.com/hack-chat/main)

hcclient is a configurable and feature-rich cross-platform terminal client for connecting to [hack.chat](https://hack.chat).

**Note:** &nbsp;This client is written to be compatible with the official live instance running at https://hack.chat. Compatibility with your own self-hosted instance or other alternate instances is not guaranteed.

<br />

## Features <a name="features"></a>
Some of the features hcclient has to offer:
- **Cross-platform:** &nbsp;Tested to work on Windows, Linux, macOS and Android. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for more information.
- **Suggestions:** &nbsp;Starting your message with `@` or `/` will bring up a menu with a list of online users or commands. Cycle through them with arrow keys or continue typing to filter the suggestions even more. Suggestion aggressiveness can be set with `--suggest-aggr`.
- **Configuration:** &nbsp;Generate and load YAML/JSON configuration files with no editing required. Change configuration options from within the client with commands, modifying behaviour and colors without having to restart. See [Configuration](#configuration) for more information.
- **Desktop notifications:** &nbsp;Receive notifications whenever someone mentions you or sends you a whisper. Android notifications are supported when running on [Termux](https://termux.dev/). See [Notifications](#notifications) for more information.
- **Aliases:** &nbsp;Set aliases for messages and phrases you send often, because why wouldn't you?
- **Whisper locking:** &nbsp;Lock the client with a command to send only whispers, preventing accidental information leaks.
- **Ignore list:** &nbsp;Message blocking using tripcodes and connection hashes.
- **Proxy support:** &nbsp;Connect through SOCKS4, SOCKS5 or HTTP proxies. Tested to work with Tor.

<br />

## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
The main requirement for any platform is a terminal emulator that supports ANSI escape sequences.

For x86_64 Linux, statically and dynamically linked binaries are provided with the interpreter and dependencies bundled in.

On other platforms, python >= 3.10 and pip are required. <br />

A [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) / [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) compatible image is provided.

<br />

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
On all platforms:
```bash
# Install the pip package
pip install hcclient

# Run hcclient
hcclient --help
```
On Arch Linux, install the [source AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hcclient) or [binary AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hcclient-bin) with makepkg or an AUR helper.<br />
On other x86_64 Linux distributions:
```bash
# Download the latest binary
wget -O hcclient https://github.com/AnnikaV9/hcclient/releases/download/v1.14.4/hcclient-1.14.4-linux-x86-64

# Or the statically linked binary if the above one doesn't work
wget -O hcclient https://github.com/AnnikaV9/hcclient/releases/download/v1.14.4/hcclient-1.14.4-linux-x86-64-static

# Make the binary executable
chmod +x hcclient

# Move it to somewhere in PATH
mv hcclient $HOME/.local/bin/

# Run hcclient
hcclient --help
```
As a container:
```bash
# Download the latest image
wget https://github.com/AnnikaV9/hcclient/releases/download/v1.14.4/hcclient-1.14.4-image.tar.xz

# Install the image
docker/podman load -i hcclient-1.14.4-image.tar.xz

# Run hcclient
docker/podman run --rm -it hcclient --help
```

## Colors <a name="colors"></a>
The default color scheme can be overidden with a configuration file. See [Configuration](#configuration) for more information.<br />
A list of valid colors can be viewed with `--colors`.

```
$ hcclient --colors

Valid colors:
 - black
 - grey
 - red
 - green
 - yellow
 - blue
 - magenta
 - cyan
 - light_grey
 - dark_grey
 - light_red
 - light_green
 - light_yellow
 - light_blue
 - light_magenta
 - light_cyan
 - white
```

<br />

## Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>
A configuration file can be generated with the provided arguments using `--gen-config` and loaded using `--load-config`. For example:

```
hcclient --gen-config
```
The above command will create *config.yml* with default options in the working directory, which can then be loaded with:
```
hcclient -c mychannel -n mynick --load-config <path_to_config.yml>
```
Generated configuration files are in YAML format by default.<br />
Alternatively, a JSON configuration file can be generated by running `--gen-config` again in the same directory. Both formats can be loaded the same way.<br />

Override defaults when generating the configuration file by specifying options:
```
hcclient --no-notify --proxy socks5:127.0.0.1:9050 --gen-config
```

hcclient searches for *config.yml* or *config.json* in the following directories by default:
- **Windows:** &nbsp;%APPDATA%/hcclient
- **Other platforms:** &nbsp;$HOME/.config/hcclient

Things to note:
- The configuration file does not affect `channel` and `nickname`, which have to be specified as flags every time.
- Command-line arguments **do not** override the configuration file's options. If a configuration file is loaded, all flags except for `--channel` and `--nickname` are discarded. Run with `--no-config` if you want to override the default configuration file.

<br />

You can also configure hcclient while it's running, without having to restart it. For example:
```
> /configset no_notify true
```
The changes will be applied live and lost once you exit the client, but you can save it to the configuration file with `/save`<br />
Configuration options can be listed with `/configdump`

<br />

## Notifications <a name="notifications"></a>

Desktop notifications are enabled by default. They can be disabled with `--no-notify` or `/configset no_notify true`<br />

hcclient doesn't have a built-in audio file for sound alerts, so you'll have to provide your own.<br />
Place a wave file named *tone.wav* in the default config directory and it will be played when a notification is sent.

Default config directory location:
- **Windows:** &nbsp;%APPDATA%/hcclient
- **Other platforms:** &nbsp;$HOME/.config/hcclient

On Linux, libnotify and aplay are required for notifications to work.

On Android, notifications are supported when running on [Termux](https://termux.dev/).<br />
Install the [Termux:API](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.api/) app and termux-api package and notifications will just work.

**Note:** &nbsp; Notifications are not supported in container mode.

<br />

## Updatable Messages <a name="updatable-messages"></a>

hack.chat has support for updatable messages, which allows editing previously sent messages on the official web client. This is usually used by bots to display streamed/delayed output.<br />
Since hcclient is a terminal client, editing messages that have been previously printed isn't possible.<br />
However, `updateMessage` events are still handled, just differently.

When an updatable message is received, it will be printed as per normal but with an unique identifier. For example:
```
23:06|jEuh/s| [⧗ 84263] [user] hi
```
Here, `84263` is the message identifier.

As the sender continues to update and edit the message, hcclient will track the changes in memory.<br />
Once the sender sends the `complete` status, the message will be printed again with the same identifier and all changes applied:
```
23:06|jEuh/s| [⧗ 84263] [user] hi
...
...
...
23:08|jEuh/s| [✓ 84263] [user] hi guys!
```
It's displayed as a new message, but it's actually the previous message, edited.

If no `complete` status is received in 3 minutes, the message will expire. All changes applied so far will be printed like normal, but with the `✗` icon instead.

**Note:** &nbsp; If `no_unicode` is enabled, the `⧗`, `✓` and `✗` icons will be replaced with `Updatable.ID:`, `Completed.ID:` and `Expired.ID:` respectively.
