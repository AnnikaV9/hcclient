## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
*"hack.chat is a minimal, distraction-free, accountless, logless, disappearing chat service which is easily deployable as your own service."* - [hack.chat](https://github.com/hack-chat/main)

hcclient is a configurable and feature-rich cross-platform terminal client for connecting to [hack.chat](https://hack.chat)

**Note:** This client is written to be compatible with the official live instance running at https://hack.chat. Compatibility with your own self-hosted instance or other alternate instances is not guaranteed.

<br />

## Features <a name="features"></a>
Some of the features hcclient has to offer:
- **Cross-platform:** Tested to work on Windows, Linux, macOS and Android. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for more information.
- **Suggestions:** Starting your message with `@` or `/` will bring up a menu with a list of online users or commands. Cycle through them with arrow keys or continue typing to filter the suggestions even more. Suggestion aggressiveness can be set with `--suggest-aggr`.
- **Markdown:** Messages are parsed as markdown, with support for bold, italics, strikethrough, code blocks, backticks, links and spec compliant escaping. See [Styling](#styling) for more information.
- **Syntax highlighting:** Code blocks in messages are highlighted with user specified languages or language guessing.
- **LaTeX simplification:** LaTeX expressions are parsed and converted to sympy expressions, which are more readable. See [LaTeX Simplification](#latex-simplification) for more information.
- **Configuration:** Generate and load YAML/JSON configuration files with no editing required. Change configuration options from within the client with commands, modifying behaviour and colors without having to restart. See [Configuration](#configuration) for more information.
- **Desktop notifications:** Receive notifications whenever someone mentions you or sends you a whisper. Android notifications are supported when running on [Termux](https://termux.dev/). See [Notifications](#notifications) for more information.
- **Aliases:** Set aliases for messages and phrases you send often, because why wouldn't you?
- **Whisper locking:** Lock the client with a command to send only whispers, preventing accidental information leaks.
- **Ignore list:** Message blocking using tripcodes and connection hashes.
- **Proxy support:** Connect through SOCKS4, SOCKS5 or HTTP proxies. Tested to work with Tor.

<br />

## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
- Python >= 3.10
- Pip
- An xterm-256color terminal emulator that supports ANSI escape sequences

Notification support requires different dependencies on different platforms, see [Notifications](#notifications) for more information.

<br />

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Cross-platform installation:
```bash
# Install the PyPI package
pip install hcclient

# Run hcclient
hcclient --help
```
For LaTeX support, install `hcclient[latex]` instead.

On Arch Linux (and most Arch-based distributions), install the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hcclient) with makepkg or an AUR helper.<br/>
This will install an isolated environment with all dependencies in `/opt/hcclient`.<br />

Alternatively, install the LaTeX enabled [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hcclient-latex).

**Note:** Starting with version 1.18.2, hcclient is no longer available as a standalone executable or container image. Only wheels are supported.

<br />

<br />

## Styling <a name="styling"></a>
The default color scheme can be overidden with a configuration file. See [Configuration](#configuration) for more information.<br />
A list of valid colors can be viewed with `--colors`.

Syntax highlighting and markdown are enabled by default. They can be disabled with `--no-markdown` or with the `no_markdown` option.<br />
The markdown implementation supports:
- **Bold:** `**bold**`
- **Italics:** `*italics*`
- **Bold-italics:** `***bold-italics***`
- **Strikethrough:** `~~strikethrough~~`
- **Code blocks:** (With syntax highlighting and language guessing)
  ````
  ```<lang>
  <code>
  ```
  ````
- **Backticks:** `` `backticks` ``
- **Links:**
  - `[link](https://example.com)`
  - `![image](https://example.com/image.png`
  - `<https://example.com>`
  - `<mailto:user@example.com`
  - `https://example.com`
  - `example.com`
- **Escaping:** `\*escaped*` (Spec compliant)

Highlight themes can be listed with `--themes` and set with `--highlight-theme` or with the `highlight_theme` option<br />
The default theme is *monokai*.

<br />

## LaTeX Simplification <a name="latex-simplification"></a>

LaTeX simplification is disabled by default. It can be enabled with `--latex` or with the `latex` option.<br />
When enabled, LaTeX expressions will be parsed and converted to sympy expressions, which are more readable.<br />

Expressions must be enclosed in `$` or `$$` for inline and block expressions respectively.<br />

For example, the following LaTeX expression:
```
$\frac{1}{2}$
```

Will be simplified and displayed as:
```
|latex: 1/2|
```

Conversion is done using [latex2sympy2](https://github.com/OrangeX4/latex2sympy).<br />
Not all LaTeX expressions are supported of course, but it's good enough for most use cases.

<br />

## Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>
A configuration file can be generated with the provided arguments using `--gen-config` and loaded using `--load-config`. For example:

```
hcclient --gen-config
```
The above command will create *config.yml* with default options in the working directory, which can then be loaded with:
```
hcclient -c mychannel -n mynick --load-config <path_to_config.yml>
```
Generated configuration files are in YAML format by default.<br />
Alternatively, a JSON configuration file can be generated by running `--gen-config` again in the same directory. Both formats can be loaded the same way.<br />

Override defaults when generating the configuration file by specifying options:
```
hcclient --no-notify --proxy socks5:127.0.0.1:9050 --gen-config
```

hcclient searches for *config.yml* or *config.json* in the following directories by default:
- **Windows:** &nbsp;%APPDATA%/hcclient
- **Other platforms:** &nbsp;$HOME/.config/hcclient

**Note:** The configuration file does not affect `channel` and `nickname`, which have to be specified as flags every time.

<br />

You can also configure hcclient while it's running, without having to restart it. For example:
```
> /configset no_notify true
```
The changes will be applied live and lost once you exit the client, but you can save it to the configuration file with `/save`<br />
Configuration options can be listed with `/configdump`

<br />

## Notifications <a name="notifications"></a>

Desktop notifications are enabled by default. They can be disabled with `--no-notify` or with the `no_notify` option<br />

hcclient doesn't have a built-in audio file for sound alerts, so you'll have to provide your own.<br />
Place a wave file named *tone.wav* in the default config directory and it will be played when a notification is sent.

Default config directory location:
- **Windows:** &nbsp;%APPDATA%/hcclient
- **Other platforms:** &nbsp;$HOME/.config/hcclient

On Linux, libnotify and aplay are required for notifications to work.

On Android, notifications are supported when running on [Termux](https://termux.dev/).<br />
Install the [Termux:API](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.api/) app and termux-api package and notifications will just work.

<br />

## Updatable Messages <a name="updatable-messages"></a>

hack.chat has support for updatable messages, which allows editing previously sent messages on the official web client. This is usually used by bots to display streamed/delayed output.<br />
Since hcclient is a terminal client, editing messages that have been previously printed isn't possible.

However, `updateMessage` events are still handled, just differently.

When an updatable message is received, it will be printed as per normal but with an unique identifier. For example:
```
23:06|jEuh/s| [⧗ 84263] [user] hi
```
Here, `84263` is the message identifier.

As the sender continues to update and edit the message, hcclient will track the changes in memory.<br />
Once the sender sends the `complete` status, the message will be printed again with the same identifier and all changes applied:
```
23:06|jEuh/s| [⧗ 84263] [user] hi
...
...
...
23:08|jEuh/s| [✓ 84263] [user] hi guys!
```
It's displayed as a new message, but it's actually the previous message, edited.

If no `complete` status is received in 3 minutes, the message will expire. All changes applied so far will be printed like normal, but with the `✗` icon instead.

**Note:** If `no_unicode` is enabled, the `⧗`, `✓` and `✗` icons will be replaced with `Updatable.ID:`, `Completed.ID:` and `Expired.ID:` respectively.

<br />

## Hooks <a name="hooks"></a>
You can tweak hcclient's behaviour by placing python scripts in the default hooks directory:<br />
- **Windows:** &nbsp;%APPDATA%/hcclient/hooks
- **Other platforms:** &nbsp;$HOME/.config/hcclient/hooks

hcclient will run `hook()` in all scripts in the hooks directory on startup.<br />
`hook()` should take a single argument, which is the client instance.

You can modify, add or remove the instance's attributes and methods to change its behaviour.<br />
The `TextFormatter` instance is available as `client.formatter`.<br />
Example hooks can be found [here](../examples/hooks).

**Note:** Hook support is experimental. hcclient is not stable and the API is subject to change, so don't expect your hooks to work after an update.
